
This project presents a comprehensive proposal for the creation of a Student Academic Advising System at Federal University Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State. The primary goal of this system is to enhance the academic advising process through the integration of various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The project will follow the Rational Unified Process Model to ensure a structured and efficient development process. The Student Academic Advising System will offer several key features, including streamlined course planning, improved communication channels between students and advisors, and personalized academic guidance. It will be comprised of distinct modules for student profile management, course selection and planning, advisor interaction, and administrative tools. To facilitate its implementation, the system will be deployed locally on XAMPP. By doing so, we anticipate significant benefits, such as heightened student satisfaction, improved retention rates, the promotion of a collaborative academic atmosphere, and a reduction in administrative workload, ultimately leading to more efficient resource utilization.
